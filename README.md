# sme-bi-case-study-application
For this stage of the application, we will ask you to create a screencast and one corresponding virtual machine exercise for a specific portion of your case study outline. 

### Getting Started 

To begin the audition portion, **fork** this repo so that a copy of this repo lives on your GitHub account.

Once you have completed the following steps, notify Instructor Success with the link to your forked copy. Make sure that we will be able to view the repo using appropriate access settings.

### Step 1: Screencast

Screencasts are used in business intelligence (BI) courses to demonstrate to learners how to achieve tasks on the user interface of the BI tool. They are **not** used in case studies, but you will create one where you walk us through the solution from your virtual machine exercise. The idea is you open a starting workbook, give some background on the problem you are trying to solve, and walk us through the different steps required to find the solution. You will create an example screencast that walks the learner through the different steps on how to solve one of your exercises, like .e.g this [one]([url](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/case-study-analyzing-customer-churn-in-tableau/exploratory-analysis-1?ex=4)). 
 
 *Tips for recording the screencast: make sure the audio narration is clear and not too fast to follow. It’s often easier to first record the audio and then record your screen while listening to the audio.* 

- [ ] Upload your screencast to your platform of choice (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive) and paste the link here: 

### Step 2: Virtual Machine Exercise

A virtual machine (VM) exercise requires learners to complete 3 - 6 actions in a Tableau Workbook or Power BI Report. A virtual machine exercise consists of:

- The measurable **learning objective** that this exercise assesses
- A **context** that engages the learner and explains why they are doing this exercise.
- 3 - 6 bulleted **instructions**
- A **question** that assesses whether the instructions were properly followed.
- Two workbook or report files:
  - The **initial file**: what the learner will begin with
  - The **solution file**: what a correct solution would look like after completing the instruction

In our [Power BI and Tableau courses](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses?technologies=Tableau&technologies=Power%20BI), you will be able to find a many virtual machine exercises that test a variety of skills.

To create your VM exercise, complete the template `vm-exercises.md`. 

### Step 3: Upload a rough version of a (almost) finalized report or dashboard
For this final step you are expected to upload a workbook with a finalized report or dashboard. This report or dashboard does not need to present the whole case study, but is the culmination of multiple exercises. We do not expect you to finish your whole case study such as shown in this public Power BI report [here](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiMGE2OWRmOTgtMmY3Yy00YTJkLWEyY2EtODE0Y2EwN2EyMGVlIiwidCI6IjlhYWU1Yjg3LTU4NDQtNDAzMS04MGEyLWVhZDE0NjNlNzNiNiIsImMiOjN9&pageName=ReportSection0da0007f61773311eb77), but we do expect you to create something similar to one of the four pages shown (representing roughly ~25% of the whole case study). This gives DataCamp a clear idea on where you want to go with the case study and which kind of tasks you expect the learner to perform.  
You can upload this workbook in the exercises folder as `ex-final-sol.twbx` or `ex-final-sol.pbix`

To create your finalized report or dashboard, complete the template `vm-exercises.md`.
